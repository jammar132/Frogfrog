Added features:
- Added lives, when fly is missed or eatten evil fly you lose lives. If all lives lost then game is over and lost. 

- Added golden flies that award +2 for score and gives +1 Heart/Life

- Added evil fly that takes away 2 lives if eaten 

- Added a score feature that keeps score 

- Added difficulty selection (Easy, normal, and hard). Speed of flies and tongue speed and health of mamafly varies. 

- Mamafly boss fight. When you accumilate a score of 25, mamafly shows up and you have to defeat it by hitting it with frogs tongue. It is useless and DOES NOT damage you, and you can not possibly lose, its just to annoy you! :D Also found it funny and cool to make it just bounce around like the DVD player thing. 
    - (tried to add rocky music for when your fighting mamafly but it would result in 'Loading...' at the top of the screen and not run the game)

- Added difficulty selection screen, intro screen, game over screen, and game won screen.
